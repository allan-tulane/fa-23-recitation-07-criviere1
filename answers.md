- **2) The work of reachable with n nodes and m edges is O(n+m).**

- **4) The worst case number of times you would have to call reachable to see if the graph is connected is n (nodes) times.**

- **5) The work of connected is also O(n+m).**

- **7) With a of n nodes, the max number of edges is O(n^2). The for loop in reachable would still be O(n) time so work would be the same.**
